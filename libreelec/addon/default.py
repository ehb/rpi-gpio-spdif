# service only (1) tells the user when that failed (bin/rpi-gpio-spdif leaves the reason in
# STATUS) and (2) restarts the unit when the add-on settings change, so that the new settings
# are written. A device that is open keeps its old configuration until it is opened again.
#
# Whether settings changed is decided by comparing the effective settings with the ones the unit
# applied (APPLIED, written by "rpi-gpio-spdif start"), not by counting events: a change made in
# the first seconds after Kodi starts is found by the check after the start-up delay, and a
# settings event that changes nothing does not restart the unit.
